# simple editor
A simple text editor written in C (in progress)
NOTE: This editor is by no means polished. Expect lots and lots of bugs, seg faults and other
strange things to happen to your text in special cases (or even on different systems). 

This program requries no external libraries (not even ncurses). A simple `make` will compile it properly. 

Thanks to viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo for helping out. Please visit that site if you would like to know how everything works.

Also, it is recommended you run this program in a graphical terminal emulator, rather than a tty, since there seems to be a strange flickering effect on ttys.
